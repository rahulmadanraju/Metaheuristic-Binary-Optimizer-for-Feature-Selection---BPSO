# Metaheuristic-Binary-Optimizer-for-Feature-Selection---BPSO
The binary version of this meta-heuristic optimizer is used for feature selection process through a wrapper based method. The Optimizer is set with a threshold value, provided they consider the random subset of data over each iteration and train the system and finally land up with minimum feature subset with best classification accuracy

The optimistic feature selection methodology which is used for feature selection process along with the performance, based on the real time applications

The research works are carried out as Master Thesis in the university TU-Chemnitz, Germany.

#Classification Function
We can call any type of classifier wrt to machine learning/Deep Learning classifiers such as SVM, DT, KNN, LDA, CNN, etc.

In order to check the performance on real time scenarios, we can use benchmark modal functions to verify the optimizer performance.

#Initialization
It enables us to assign the no. of search agents which help in searching the points of best solution in the given search space.

#Function plots
This code gives the resultant plot for a series of seaeching points in the search space and best possible outcomes for a series of operations carried out.
